- You want to create a website for a company, foundation, agency, meetup, group, organization that seldom update contents.
- You are going to use a static site generator.
- You don't want to backup a database and image files.
- You don't want to pay for a hosting/database/CDN and pay only for domain name.
  - For public repository, you can use GitHub Pages.
  - For private repository, you can use Cloudflare Workers.
- You want to create Progressive Web Apps (PWA).
- You want to work with a new technologies out of the box without any extra setup, e.g.
  - TypeScript
  - Sass
  - GraphQL is ready to use and no addition setup. All .md, image, YAML files and other assets are exposed as GraphQL resources that you can query to construct a new page in a website.

# Gatsby isn't suitable if:

- The web admin is not a developer. To modify the content or design, it requires programming skills.
- You want the admin control panel to modify the content.
- Your content will be changed quite often, it's more difficult to modify content than using the admin control panel.
  - If you want to update the content on a mobile or public computer, it might be not convenient. The computer requires specific tools such as an editor, git command, etc.
- You rely on traditional technologies like basic HTML and CSS renderer tools. Other tools will be suitable for you such as:
  - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - for Ruby user
  - [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (11ty) for JavaScript/Node user (The concept almost closes to Jekyll)
  - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - for Go user
