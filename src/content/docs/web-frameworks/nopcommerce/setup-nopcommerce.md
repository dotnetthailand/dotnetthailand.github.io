```sh
tree . -a
.
├── .env
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── entrypoint.sh
├── init-db.sql
└── initialize.sh

```

# Launch Docker containers
- At root folder, run the following command:
```sh
docker-compose up

```
- This will take a several minutes because you have to wait for downloading SQL Server for Linux image.
- Wait until you see a message **"Done initialize a database"**
