# Actions
Actions are standalone commands that are combined into steps to create a job. Actions are the smallest portable building block of a workflow. You can create your own actions, or use actions created by the GitHub community. To use an action in a workflow, you must include it as a step.

# actions/upload-artifact
- Use to upload artifacts built from your workflow, this allows you to share data between jobs and store data once a workflow is complete.
- https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact
- Artifacts are retained for 90 days by default. https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy
- *** We can't specify an artifact as the package path for the Azure deployment action (azure/webapps-deploy).
```yaml
- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: release
    path: ${{ env.BUILD_DIR }}
```
