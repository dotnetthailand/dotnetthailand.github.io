# Install .NET on Ubuntu LTS
- Follow [How to install .NET on Ubuntu LTS document](/programming-cookbook/wsl-powershell-useful-scripts/install-dotnet) to install .NET on Ubuntu LTS.

# Install Orchard Template
- Use the following command to install a new project template
  To check the latest version, please refer to the [release package](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/releases) page.
  ```sh
  $ dotnet new install "OrchardCore.ProjectTemplates::2.1.2"
  ```
- Create a new folder with name `orchard-example`, we will use it as a root folder of our project.
- Inside the root folder, create a folder named `src` to store the project's source code.
- CD to `orchard-example/src`.
- Use `dotnet new occms` command to create a new OrchardCore CMS project named `OrchardExample.Cms`.
- *You can change a project's name to any name that you want.*
  ```sh
  $ mkdir -p orchard-example/src
  $ cd orchard-example/src
  $ dotnet new occms --name OrchardExample.Cms --framework net8.0
  ```

# Open the project with VS Code
- CD back to the root folder (`orchard-example`).
- Launch VS Code.
  ```sh
  $ cd orchard-example
  $ code .
  ```

# Optionally add preview package source. You dont' need to do this step.
- At root of the project, create `nuget.config` file.
- Add the following code to the file.
  ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <configuration>
      <packageSources>
        <clear />
        <add key="NuGet" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
        <add key="OrchardCorePreview" value="https://nuget.cloudsmith.io/orchardcore/preview/v3/index.json" />
      </packageSources>
      <disabledPackageSources />
    </configuration>
  ```
- **Warning**, we do not suggest you to use the dev packages in production.

# Explore the project's file structure
- In VS Code integrated terminal, you can execute the following command to see the project structure.
  ```sh
  $ tree -I "bin|obj" .
  .
  ├── nuget.config
  └── src
      └── OrchardExample.Cms
          ├── NLog.config
          ├── OrchardExample.Cms.csproj
          ├── Program.cs
          ├── Properties
          │   └── launchSettings.json
          ├── appsettings.json
          └── wwwroot
  ```

# Launch a website
- In VS Code, press **ctrl + `** to launch the integrated terminal.
- Run the project with the following command:
  ```sh
  $ cd src/OrchardExample.Cms
  $ dotnet run
  ```
*Note*, please make sure you've saved all changes before running the command.
- FYI, `dotnet run` automatically download all Nuget packages so you don't need to explicitly run `dotnet restore`.
- Please refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run#implicit-restore for more information.

# Set up a new Orchard CMS website
- Open a browser and navigate to https://localhost:5001.
- You will find Orchard Core CMS setup page.

- *Tip*, you can put **chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost** command setting in Chrome's address bar, enable that setting and relaunch Chrome to not show warning message on localhost.
- Set up a new website with any name you want and use **Blog recipe**.
- Use SQLite to simplify our project. For using it as production database, please refer to https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html.
- *Note*, if you are going to use other database types, you need to create an empty database before setting up a website.**.
- Set an admin's username and email to any values you want.
- Click `Finish setup` button.
- You will be redirected to a home page.
- Go to an admin site by navigating to https://localhost:5001/admin and log in with your admin's username and password.
