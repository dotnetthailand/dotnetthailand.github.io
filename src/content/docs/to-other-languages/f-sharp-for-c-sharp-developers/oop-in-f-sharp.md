# Introduction #

How to write a class in F#? This chapter explains Object-oriented "capabilities" in F#. *Warning*, though, Object-Oriented feature is the second-class citizen in F#, meaning OOP model in F# is simpler than C#, for example there is no `protected` access level in F#... **OOP in F# is just for interoperation with C# libraries**.

# Class #

## Simple Class ##

Let's create a simple `Point` class for comparison. Note that since F# uses immutable data types by default, the example is also immutable for simplicity sake.

```csharp
// Point.cs
using System;

namespace Example {
    public class Point {
        public int X { get; }
        public int Y { get; }
        public Point(int x, int y){
            X = x;
            Y = y;
        }
        /// <summary>
        /// Distance of this point from origin (0,0)
        /// </summary>
        public double CalculateDistance() => Math.Sqrt(X*X + Y*Y);
    }
}
```

In F#:

```fsharp
// Point.fs
module Example

type Point(x: int, y: int) =
    member my.X = x
    member my.Y = y
    
    /// Distance of this point from origin (0,0)
    member my.CalculateDistance() = sqrt(double(me.X * me.X + me.Y * me.Y))
```

Much shorter and more pleasant code, isn't it? ðŸ˜† Generally, writing a class in F# is shorter and terse due to its simpler syntaxes.  To define a class, use keyword `type` following by a class name and constructor parameters. This line `type Point(x: int, y: int)` declares the class `Point` and the constructor in one line, neat, right?

Next 2 lines defines `X` and `Y` properties. Note that it can refer to the constructor's parameter right away! The word `my` is a custom identifier representing the object instance.  You can use any name on this part, F# doesn't have keyword `this`.  People often use the word `this` but, for me, I often use `me` or `my` as it's shorter. ðŸ˜Š

The last line is to define the method `CalculateDistance`, this one is very much like C#'s but shorter due to type omission, though you may notice that the method's body is longer.  This is because `X` and `Y` are `int` but to use `sqrt` function, the parameter needs to be floating-point number.  So, that `double()` function is actually a way to cast `int` to `double` in F#.

### Private Member ###

If you don't specify, all F# declarations are public by default.  F# has only public or private access-level. To mark a member as private, put `private` keyword after `member`.

```fsharp
// Point.fs
module Example

type Point(x: int, y: int) =
    member my.X = x
    member my.Y = y
    
    // private method
    member private my.CalculatePower2() = double(me.X * me.X + me.Y * me.Y) 

    /// Distance of this point from origin (0,0)
    member my.CalculateDistance() = sqrt(my.CalculatePower2())
```

### Empty Class ###

To implement an empty class, we must use _full form_ class declaration, which begins with `class` and ends with `end`.

```fsharp
type EmptyClass() = class end
```

## Static Class?? ##

What is comparable to C#'s `static class` is F#'s `module`, for example:

```csharp
public static class MyUtils {
    public static double Distance(int x, int y) => Math.Sqrt(X*X + Y*Y);
}
```

This can be written as a function under a module:

```fsharp
module MyUtils =
    let Distance(x: int, y: int) = sqrt(double(x * x + y * y))
```

(Little note, `Distance` is not a proper conventional function name in F#, a proper one should be `distance` -- camelCase.)
